# EthicAI-Potholes-Detection


## Introduction


Through this work unique an unique, ethical AI-driven methodology is proposed in order to automate pothole detection, evaluate severity, and support the road management system,The cutting-edge
YOLOv8 architecture for object detection is the foundation of this methodology,and the suggested solution is intended for an onboard system thatcombines a camera that is strategically mounted in the compartment of
a vehicle and seamlessly synchronized with a computational apparatus.

## Methodology

The accurate proposed methodology is proposed through this figure:

## Experiments:

Experiments are conducted using YOLOv8 family model for object detection comparing

1. Different size of the pretrained model by Ultralitycs  source:[https://github.com/ultralytics]  -->   {Nano - Small - Medium}
   
2. Different training strategies    --> {Full training - Feature Extraction - Fine Tuning}
